                    <span class="highlight">Nature & Humanity</span> — a timeless bond that shapes both survival and
                    spirituality.
                    Forests aren’t just trees and leaves — they are homes, traditions, and sacred places. Indigenous
                    tribes have
                    lived in harmony with forests for generations, nurturing a deep respect and understanding of the
                    land.<br><br>
                    The forest gives life: food, shelter, medicine, and a sense of belonging. It's time we understand
                    and protect
                    this relationship — not just for them, but for us all.
