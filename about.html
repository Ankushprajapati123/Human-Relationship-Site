            <h1>About Human Relationship with Forest</h1>
            <p>
                Forests have always played a vital role in the development of human civilization. They provide essential
                resources such as food, medicine, shelter, and fuel. Beyond these tangible benefits, forests contribute
                to the ecological balance and support biodiversity, which ultimately sustains human life.
            </p>

            <p>

                Many indigenous communities live in forests and depend on them for their livelihood. They have a deep
                cultural and spiritual bond with nature. Their traditional knowledge and sustainable practices help
                protect forest ecosystems and maintain ecological balance.

                Modern activities like deforestation, mining, and urbanization are damaging forests. This threatens
                wildlife and affects people who rely on forests. To ensure a sustainable future, humans must protect
                forests through conservation, responsible use, and support for forest communities
